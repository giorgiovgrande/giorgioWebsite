    <h3>Ambitions</h3>
    <p>My name is Giorgio and it is my goal to break into the digital sector
             as a junior developer, one day becoming a Senior Architect. 
             This lofty ambition is a constant, yet is also broken down to smaller, 
             more temporary goals. The first of these is to train, to redefine my career, 
             and so, I am thrilled to be making the most of the opportunity afforded to me at 
             Code Nation.

    <h3>My Background</h3>
    <p>
            A little about my background: perhaps unusual for a prospective developer; 
            I have foundations in the fashion industry, working as a writer for various 
            publications, including 160grams and Voir. I have had the opportunity to work 
            at London Fashion Week, reviewing collections and even interviewing key figures 
            like the esteemed photographer, Rankin. Following this, 
            I also took the opportunity to work as a model, working for brands such as 
            Toni & Guy, Babyliss Pro and Cindy Kihn.

    <h3>Code Nation</h3>
    <p>Having worked with HTML when creating web content as a writer, 
        Develop: Coding represented an opportunity to advance my technical skillset, 
        and through coding, I have been able to apply both my logical and creative minds. 
        I am relishing the opportunity to showcase my problem solving ability, to foster my 
        talents and to face continuous learning and challenges. 
    </p>
    <p>Code Nation has represented an excellent yet accessible entry point into my 
        sector of choice. Having faced many failures, I am keen to make the most of 
        golden opportunities, knowing how rare they can be.
