    <h2> 2.1 Review the ongoing use of IT tools and change approach as needed 
        – in making your own website, are you happy with the tools you used? 
        E.g. Visual Studio Code, Codepen, Trello.</h2>
    </br>
    <p>I am happy with the ongoing use of the IT tools used. For instance, 
        Visual Studio Code has provided an organic and intuitive manner of 
        testing and updating my content, code and the web layout as I went. 
        This allowed me to stay on top of each change as it was made, rather 
        than relying on producing lengthy code and uploading it all at once. 
        Using Visual Studio Code also enabled me to spot any errors during the 
        debugging process.</p>
        <p>Trello was used to monitor ongoing tasks required to get my site live. 
        For instance, once I had completed a task, no matter how small, 
        I moved it to the completed column as to focus on the next step required. 
        I also used google fonts and pantone.com to find the desired fonts and colours 
        for my design.</p>
    <div></div>
    <h2>2.2 Describe whether the IT tools selected were appropriate.</h2>
    <br>
    <p>Visual Studio Code has been highly appropriate as an IT tool. 
        Specifically, it has allowed me to compile all of my content in various HTML 
        documents, while linking to a CSS document that changed the style accordingly. 
        VSC both allowed me to experiment with code as I went, for instance, 
        when making changes to colours and updating my document in real-time.</p>
    <p>Trello may have been somewhat unnecessary due to the fact that there weren’t 
        any tasks to delegate to team members. Moreover, the Kanban methods of analysing 
        ongoing progresses are less relevant when performing a systematic sequence of 
        tasks individually (the writing and uploading of content) rather than a 
        programming complex code within a team.</p>
    <div></div>
    <h2>2.3 Assess the strengths and weaknesses of your final project.</h2> 
    <br>
    <p>I think the having well-written and detailed content is a particular 
        strength of my project. I am indeed happy with the overall look of 
        the site and I am content with the colours and design elements chosen. 
        However, in an ideal world, there would be a more intuitive relationship 
        between content and style. By this, I mean interactive elements that may 
        include SVG animations,  parallax scrolling and hover reveals. 
        Although I believe the website is open, it could be more accessible, 
        with audio description for the visually impaired, and perhaps having 
        blocks of text appear as you scroll, rather than appearing all at once, 
        which could appear overwhelming.</p>
    <div></div>
    <h2>2.4 Describe further improvements you can make to your project.</h2>
    <br>
   <p>I would have liked to have added video content, and find a way of 
       embedded PDF files in order to showcase a digital portfolio of my work. 
       In addition, I would have liked to add more interactive features using 
       Javascript, such as having content appear as I scrolled down the page. 
       These features have been outlined earlier, including SVG animations 
       and parallax scrolling.</p>
    <div></div>
   <h2>2.5 Review outcomes to make sure they match requirements and are fit for purpose.</h2>
<br>
    <p>I am confident that each outcome is fit for purpose, I have prioritised 
        a thorough approach when it comes to answering the questions, 
        ensuring that each of my outcomes have sufficient yet clear content.</p>
    <div></div>
     
    <h2> 3.1 Review the benefits and drawbacks of IT tools and systems 
        used in terms of productivity and efficiency.</h2>
    <br>
    <p>I could have made the process of building my website more efficient 
        by writing content directly into my code, rather than copy and 
        pasting it from a separate document. However, the way that Visual Studio Code’s 
        interface is displayed makes generating long bodies of text awkward and 
        hard to read. I don’t think working in teams would have made writing 
        content or code any easier, given that the code was simple and subject 
        to personal tastes. However, having a QA could have only improved the 
        testing process.</p>
    <div></div>
    3.2 Describe ways to improve productivity and efficiency 
    
    A useful way to improve productivity and efficiency would be to use a time management tool, such as ‘Focus Booster,’ which employs the principles of the 'Pomodoro Technique’ and so uses a digital timer to break down work into bursts of productivity with regular intervals. For instance, this would have helped my focus and helped reduce time pressures.
    
    3.3 Develop solutions to improve own productivity using IT in digital projects – what would you do differently next time? Team work? Use of Slack? 
    
    I would have improved my productivity by ensuring I adopted the Pomodoro methods as outlined above, while also making sure I consulted Trello and its break-down of tasks. For instance, it is easy to get lost in the ‘flow’ of your current task, neglecting to stay abridge of the Kanban methods applied in Trello. It would have be more efficient to change tasks to ‘ongoing’ or ‘complete’ as soon as I did them, as I was guilty of compartmentalising and updating Trello ‘on bulk’ later in the day.
    
    3.4 Describe how you would go about testing digital solutions.
    
    I would test digital solutions through the debugging process, checking for errors on Virtual Studio Code. However, I would also pair up with a fellow develop once the work was complete. At this stage, I would ask them to act as a QA, checking and testing my code for errors.
    
    Once my site is up and running, I would employ several engagement tools to measure its effectiveness. For instance, I could use a Biometric User Experience lab tool to diagnose how my users engage with the content, and where users may lose interest. Further analytics software can test UX with eye tracking, discerning what part of the site is drawing my user’s attention (sticking points) as opposed to  what part loses it (pain points). Google Analytics, on the other hand, is a simple way to measure engagement, to develop a deeper understanding of what works for my customers.
