        1.5 Describing copyright and other constraints affecting websites 

Many legal guidelines for digital projects lie within copyright laws. For instance, the understanding of copyright principles are essential for any blogger, researcher, developer or any one working within intellectual property. Not only is it pertinent to know how you can properly make use of someone else’s work, but better protect your own ideas. Owning a copyright gives you the exclusive right to publish, copy or reproduce your work. Should someone do this without hour permission, they are infringing your copyright and are subject to legal recourse. The Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988 also restricts the images, videos and content elements that developers can use on a project, protecting against those who would plagiarise or use content without the required permissions. 

1.6 Describing access issues that need taking into account - describe issues that people with disabilities may face when using webpages and how we can overcome them 

In addition, as per 2019, developers must ensure that their work is in line with the UK government’s accessibility requirements. In such case, it is a legal requirement that a developer must identify possible accessibility issues in software’s content and design, implementing any fixes in code. To be exact, a developer must ensure their project meets level AA of the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG 2.1) as a minimum, while also working on the most commonly used assistive technologies, such as screen magnifiers and speech recognition tools. In addition, people wot disabilities must be used in user research and throughout the testing process.

1.7 Describe which are the appropriate filetypes for websites 

Appropriate file types for websites are those that will run on most internet browsers, and include HTML, CSS, JavaScript, JPEG and GIF. For instance, a HTML file will contain the content for your site whereas CSS will style it. JavaScript, on the other hand will add interactive elements to a webpage, where JPEG, GIFs and AVI describe the visual and audio content that you would like to add to your webpage.
