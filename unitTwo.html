    <p>I have four pages, a landing page for the ‘about me’ section,

    <h2>1.5 Describing copyright and other constraints affecting websites.</h2>
    <p>Many legal guidelines for digital projects lie within copyright laws. 
        For instance, the understanding of copyright principles are essential 
        for any blogger, researcher, developer or any one working within 
        intellectual property.</p>

        <p>Not only is it pertinent to know how you can 
        properly make use of someone else’s work, but better protect your own ideas. 
        Owning a copyright gives you the exclusive right to publish, 
        copy or reproduce your work. Should someone do this without hour permission, 
        they are infringing your copyright and are subject to legal recourse. 
        The Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988 also restricts the images, 
        videos and content elements that developers can use on a project, 
        protecting against those who would plagiarise or use content without 
        the required permissions.</p>
<div></div>
    <h2>1.6 - Describing access issues that need taking into account.</h2>
    <br>
    <p>In addition, as per 2019, developers must ensure that their work is 
in line with the UK government’s accessibility requirements. In such case, 
it is a legal requirement that a developer must identify possible accessibility 
issues in software’s content and design, implementing any fixes in code.</p> 
<p>To be exact, a developer must ensure their project meets level AA of the 
Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG 2.1) as a minimum, while also 
working on the most commonly used assistive technologies, such as screen 
magnifiers and speech recognition tools. In addition, people wot disabilities 
must be used in user research and throughout the testing process.</p>

<h2>1.7 -cDescribe which are the appropriate filetypes for websites.</h2>
<br>
<p>Appropriate file types for websites are those that will run on most internet browsers, 
and include HTML, CSS, JavaScript, JPEG and GIF. For instance, a HTML file will 
contain the content for your site whereas CSS will style it. JavaScript, on the 
other hand will add interactive elements to a webpage, where JPEG, GIFs and AVI 
describe the visual and audio content that you would like to add to your webpage.</p>
